# Cursor Project Rules — Non-Standard Meme Coin Landing (React, Neo-Brutalism)

## Code Style

- Always use TypeScript with React functional components and hooks.
- Use SCSS modules for styling, organized by component.
- Keep files clean and modular — no inline styles unless for micro-experiments.
- Use semantic HTML tags and accessible aria attributes.

## Design Language: Neo-Brutalism

- Color palette: Bright pastels + neon (#FF00A0, #00FFD1, #FFE600, black, white).
- Typography: Bold, geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk / Clash Display) for headings, Inter for body.
- Layout: Asymmetrical grid + Flexbox, avoid pixel-perfect symmetry.
- Borders: Thick (3px+), black or high contrast.
- Shadows: Harsh, offset, 4px to 12px, solid black.
- Buttons: Chunky, blocky, with bold hover/focus states.
- Imagery: Flat geometric shapes, playful raw elements, hand-drawn accents.
- Animations: Pop-in, slight jitter, sudden transitions; use framer-motion for smoothness.

## Animation

- Keep animations performant, GPU-accelerated.
- Prefer framer-motion for scroll + hover effects.
- For mascot: Use react-three-fiber + drei for 3D scene; keep low-poly.

## General Rules

- Lazy load heavy assets.
- Use SVGs for icons.
- All pages responsive, but preserve brutalist layout feel on mobile.
- SEO-ready: meta tags, OG tags, Twitter cards.
